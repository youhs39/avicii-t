  <h2> Waithing For Love</h2>


  <h4>Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful<br>
And every night has its day, so magical<br>
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle<br>
That can't be defeated<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Simon Aldred]<br>
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable<br>
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle<br>
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable<br>
With something to believe in<p><p sytle="margin-top150px;">
Monday left me broken<br>
Tuesday I was through with hoping<br>
Wednesday my empty arms were open<br>
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love<br>
Thank the stars it's Friday<br>
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday<br>
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday<br>
I'll be waiting for love,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ncIVUXZla8" target="_blank"> waiting for love</a>
<br>To come around<br></h4>
