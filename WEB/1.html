  <h2> WAKE ME UP</h2>


  <h4>Feeling my way through the darknessa<br>
Guided by a beating heart<br>
I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
But I know where to start.<br>
hey tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
My life will pass me by if I don't<br>
open up my eyes<br>
Well its fine by me.<p><p style="margin-top150px;">
so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrbM1l_BoI"
target="_blank">wake me up</a> when its all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself<br>
And I didn't know I was lost.<br>
so wake me up when its all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself<br>
And I didn't know I was lost.<br></h4>
